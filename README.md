# EESSI data for API endpoints
This repository is designed to analyse the software shipped via EESSI and create metadata around that software.
The metadata is collected in CI and stored in the webpage generated by the repository ([eessi.io/api_data](https://www.eessi.io/api_data/)).

The scripts that create the metadata are stored in the `scripts` directory.
