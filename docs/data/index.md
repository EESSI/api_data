# Data files

There are two types of data files, a raw yaml data and processed json data files. The raw yaml file
is generated automatically by scripts in the repository hosting this documentation. The json files
are processed versions of this data to serve particular purposes, e.g., to facilitate the generation
of documentation about the software that is shipped via EESSI.

This page is automatically updated to provide the most versions and descriptions of these files.

## Raw YAML data

The raw yaml data is a large complex object, primarily used as the source of truth for the json
data generation scripts. The file is generated automatically in CI.
